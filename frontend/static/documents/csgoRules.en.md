# TTÜ E-Sport

Rules for the upcoming LAN party that will be held 9.-11. February

## 1. General

These rules are based on ESL 5on5 Open League ruleset, however they are tailored differently to match our
needs. These rules are set to ensure a fair match between players.

Please note that Game Master (GM) may change these rules at any moment.

Any changes that players might want to change have to be coordinated with the GM and teams first. Any arrangements that
have been made have to be written down. 
This does not include GM decisions depending on the circumstances to ensure fair match.

### 1.1 Agreements

* GM can make changes in the ruleset and make decisions not established in the ruleset to ensure fair match.
* Each participant has to be acquainted with the tournament rules and overall LAN rules.
* By participating in the tournament, the players agree to said rules.
* The entire team is responsible for their players - if one of the participants commits offence against the rules, 
these penalties apply to all team members.

### 1.2 Cheating

* Players caught cheating will be disqualified with their team from the tournament.
* Depending on the severity of cheating they might be disqualified entering any future tournaments
hosted by TTÜ E-Sport.

ambient occlusion, third-party created assisting programs and Lua scripts.

### 1.2.1 Unbanning

* Depending on the circumstances where a player/team has been banned from entering competitions there can be a withdraw
for that ban if there is enough evidence that player/team has learned from previous situation.

## 2. Demos

It is required by **each** player to record their point-of-view (POV) demo per map for the full duration without
exceptions. Failure to show players POV demo when asked by staff or GM may result in a win for the opposing team.
If there is a cheating suspicion by staff or GM then demo for that player will be checked.

Player is not required to send their POV demo to another player when asked. Any suspicion of cheating
has to be reported to GM immediately. GM may distribute these demos per need.

Demos have to be compressed into an archive (.zip, .rar). Demos will be uploaded to internal server.
These demos cannot be uploaded to online when requested by GM or staff. Demos cannot be tampered or edited in any way.

Accusation of cheating can only be pointed out during the competition. Any accusations after the event are not valid,
since this is LAN
